# Coursework-Hardik_Pandit-24023942

This is a Java-based staff recruitment system made for my university coursework. It uses OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts like inheritance and polymorphism, and includes a simple GUI made with Swing.

- Features
Add Full-Time and Part-Time staff
Display staff details (only if they’ve joined)
Update info like salary or shifts
Terminate part-time staff
Menu-style GUI using JFrame, JButton, etc.

- Technologies Used
Java (Core + OOP)
Java Swing (GUI)
No database – it stores data temporarily during runtime

- Files
StaffHire.java – Base class (superclass)
FullTimeStaffHire.java – Handles full-time staff logic
PartTimeStaffHire.java – Handles part-time staff logic
RecruitmentSystem.java – Main GUI app

- What I Learned
How to design with inheritance and subclasses
Encapsulation using getters/setters
Method overriding in child classes
Swing GUI development from scratch (no drag-drop)

- Note
This project is console+GUI based – no persistent storage like files or DB
GUI is built using pure Java code
